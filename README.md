# Noctalgia

In Noctalgia, players step into the shoes of a frog whose home has been lost to the effects of light pollution. Determined to make a difference, the frog documents ways humans can help, but mischievous enemies scatter the journal pages across the forest. Players must guide the frog as he retrieves his pages and shows humans how to undo the harm done to his friends and family.

The name Noctalgia evokes "sky grief," reflecting the game’s poignant theme. Its art style carries a nostalgic tone, mirroring the story’s emotional journey. Designed to raise awareness about light pollution and inspire the use of technology for real-world solutions, Noctalgia blends a heartfelt narrative with the engaging twists and turns of a classic platformer.
